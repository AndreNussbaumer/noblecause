Our jobs and specializations somehow end up shaping who we are.

Take for instance a programmer. The people who spend a lot of time coding, somehow develop the sense of a matrix, due to the many similarities it has with life. The 'for loop' is a block of code that keeps running until a condition is met. This could explain Saṃsāra, about attaining enlightenment and only then being able to break free from the cycle. From the loop. Inevitably we as humans start to become the jobs we have. Another example is the economists, who become ruthless, distant and cold. First, being emotionless is a must in order not to create bonds that will disable you from screwing another person on a deal. Secondly, the coldness inside settles in, much like numbers, they are all rational and logical, not emotional. 1+1 it's not an emotional state. It's solid rock. There's no flexibility in it. It is, what it is. Deterministic. Being overly rational and logical is obviously not good, as it leads to a completely unbalanced mind. I don't think you are born an economist. You are shaped into one. All these characteristics they acquire, it's solely because of what their job stands for and not who they really are. Our jobs format who we are, and by formatting us, they format the way we see the world. Unknowingly our decisions are based in one we did while younger. In such an increasingly fast paced world, and where we live longer than we ever did, specializations sounds something completely outdated, specially(no pun intended) with such extent and easy to access pool of knowledge, a.k.a the Internet. In my opinion specializations don't benefit the individual. Obviously there's a myriad of specializations that are indeed very important, and only by studying them for a very long time, we are able to do them right, but still, I believe we should always keep a broaden interest of topics as we can grasp seemingly unrelated patterns from one another, thus improving that which we know the best. The academic path we take isn't certainly thought to make us leaders, but rather followers. In this moment in time, earth is scarce of good leaders. The education system is in a need of a reform, because it's somehow becoming like a business. Education should never, be a business, because it's purpose lies in creating better human beings, and not better tools.

  The schools that were made to prepare students for a factory are still operating under the same conditions. The ring bell, the desk which mimics what would be your working space and the manager overseeing the workers. The workers in the factory were supposed to do one thing, and one thing only. The better they'd become at it, the faster they would be, hence more profitable. People have to start learning about a myriad of different jobs. This, not only buys them safe nets allowing them to become more vocal about social injustices, but also creates a much less consumerist society. When you know how to produce and create your own products, you're much less likely to acquire them. Independence in this matter is a must. Developing and nurturing one's curiosity throughout our academic career will stimulate human creativity, allowing them to be more productive and valuable to our society. Given my interest in the full automation of the basic needs for our survival, I've been thinking on how we can automate Education. I've came up with an idea, called the 'Learning Hubs.' Teachers, belonging to that fantastic family called Humanity, are prone to an unconscious favoritism among students. Be it because of their parents political views, nationality or maybe because he has a mohawk and questions them systematically. Whatever the reason is, we'll always make judgments based on our memories and feelings. Given our age and time, why isn't everyone learning from the best of the best? Can you imagine, every citizen aspiring to be a writer having classes with a modern Tolstoy? Or an electrical engineer, receiving rivers of knowledge from sir Tesla? A video that is organic, it's always being made better, being updated and improved upon the feedback from students. If something isn't clear enough, there will be another take. It's never something fixed. Anyone can watch them, parents can watch them and see how their children are being taught. How they are being taught. I mean, with such an array of incredible tools given by our scientific development, why aren't we delivering the best educational system this world has ever seen? Is it because there's an interest in ignorance? Why do we keep repeating a job that can be fully automated? My proposal for this project will be out soon enough.
