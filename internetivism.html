    <p id="center">Let's start with the root of the problem, literally. Or the solution, actually.</p>
    <p id="center">Internet is nothing but a representation at a lower scale of what nature has been doing for millions of years—exchanging nutrients through mycorrhizal networks, or the wood wide web, as some call it. But, we can't exchange nutrients through the internet... Or can we?  A simple money transfer over the internet allows me to get the nutrients I need. Sometimes even a word can be nutritious. Food for thought. Words not only nurture our souls, but our hearts too. Internetivism is all about that.

  <p id="main-content">
    We've always been evolving, the universe expands, our minds get bigger, even our hearts. Not in a physical way, but in an empathetic one. Why is it so hard to achieve social change? It's simple. Those in power despise it, because social change means a change in the status-quo, and in this system, a change in the status-quo means toppling those powers. Take the discoveries of Copernicus for instance. Why was progress abominable? Think about it for a second. Progress... Abominable. Something to be silenced about. What kind of unnatural creatures would be against what's only natural? To see a river flow, to see mankind coming together and behaving like humans, using their god given ability of communication to overcome secular quarrels? Well, his discoveries only jeopardized the entire system they lived in. Like a bolt of lightning striking through one's skull. Suddenly there's nothing but light. How dangerous was that, to know that those in power have been lying to you, told you that you were unworthy, that you must bow down to a god that now, isn't really the center of everything. Now there were other things they should worry about. Other stars to be appreciated. Other worlds to be found. Yeah, that's a bit crazy, for that time.

    <p id="main-cont1"><b>The battle between darkness and light still wages on. If you want to understand more about what this darkness is all about, and what this light stands for, you can find it in my book:</b><i> <a href="https://andrenussbaumer.github.io/anwebsite/fdtl.html" target="_blank">"From <b>darkness</b> to <b>light</b>."</a></i></p>
  <p id="main-content">
One way I found very useful to fight the darkness, or the ignorance if you're not yet familiar with the terminology, is through the Internet. Our laptops and mobile phones became the stars of our generation. We no longer look up to the skies and question why, no, we now look down and ask Google. It's easier, it avoids getting eaten by darkness's immensity. You see, before the internet, artists and activists expressed their selves in the streets and walls of our cities, with messages of hope, calls to action, they exposed injustices or simply revamped our squared aesthetics. Whatever their motives might've been, it worked. The streets where we all commuted to work, served as a canvas, where the information came out from the public and not the private. This was the way the silenced voices of the masses found. That must be why the government was so averse to this type of art. Because it gave people a voice. They could now say, and make people see, what others never wanted. It was a nuisance for those who built so carefully their kingdoms of propaganda. Now, there are more people on the internet, than in any other city in the world. This makes the internet the perfect canvas for Activists to share a bit of light. Yes, although our screens are very lit, the content we often read is everything but enlightened. Youtube's comment section became the slums of the intellectual castrated, once the ruling party understood the power it held and weaponized it. So many harmful propaganda instilled in them. Rabid groups of racists who assemble in a homogeneous group, to spread ignorance amongst every god damn Youtube video. It's like a battleground, where in some, the light wins, that is, the voice of reason, of tolerance and justice, and in others, the voice of the unreasonable, inflexible and intellectually castrated rabble.
It's not that most of the people on the internet are stupid, it's just that some get paid for that.
