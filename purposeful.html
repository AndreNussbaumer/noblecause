    Purposeful design - Products created with humanistic
    values that seek to improve mankind.

<div class="main-cont">
  <p id="main-content">
    <p id="center">Most products we create are embbeded with the values that the system we live in instilled
in us, and sometimes, unknowingly, we contribute to the creation of self-centered
products that in nothing contributes to this organism we're part of. It
is time to start making more collaborative and transparent products
that promotes unity instead of detachment and alienation. We believe
we can improve society, and if we are to do so, then we must
start with the products it consumes. We call it purposeful design.
</p>
    <p id="main-content">At this point in time our mindset has been shaped to accept without questioning the system we live in. That idea has been
sold to us through cinema, through novels and through music. The capital has been able to turn the purity in the artistic sector into
machines of propaganda that work fully, and solely, in the interest of their agendas. War games for instance, one can think
about their innocence and how they were devised to cater to a niche in the entertainment sector, but that would be rather naive.
Obviously these types of games serve as a gateway, as a boot camp, a recruitment for those who haven't found their tribe yet. They
know exactly their audience and who they are after. Nowadays the military complex resembles a lot to those games. It's almost as if a drill,
for the soldiers don't have to be on the battlefield given all the automation in the military complex. Throughout the gaming industry
you will find that most of them have a political reason for existing. You see, for big corporations, there are people who fund those games,
and they more often than not aren't fond of creating entertainment without instilling in them their philosophy. Harry Potter comes
to mind when I think of products that I once loved, but now understand that they had a reason to be so successful. It's not by chance.
Harry Potter sold a completely consumerist history to my generation. A story telling us that a Wizard needs the Nimbus 2000 to become
a better seeker. What kind of message is that. Yes, you need the next Iphone 10, or Galaxy S6. Don't tell me these things are made by
chance. I, as a writer, understand the underlying implications of what I try to convey. Harry Potter is like an album, wasn't written
by one person, but by a team, and much like a cinema director, J.K Rowling got all the credits for it. I will not enter into a deeper
analysis of this story because my feelings are very ambivalent. These are just two examples, I could go on forever with music, but
for now I'll use only these to make my point clear.
    </p>
  <p id="main-cont1"><b><i>If we are to change society into something better, then the products
we create must reflect everything in which we believe to be good,
such as inclusivity, transparency, sustainability, openness and cooperation,
which are the pillars of an advanced society.
</i></b></p>
  <p id="main-content">

    In a certain way I believe we are what we consume, therefore we must
    start to design products differently if we are to see a change. Why don't we have scientific phones that are more inclined for people
    to understand biology and therefore understanding better themselves? For instance phones with incorporated microscopes
    that can identify different atoms and cells at the distance
    of a simple tap. You can check the quality of the water in your house.
    The AI and lenses will be so developed that it can evaluate the percentage
    of plastic running through the fish that you eat.
    You can identify different types of stones, mushrooms and leaves.
    If certain plants are edible, what is their use and purpose.
    It's time for us to take our heads out of these holes we've dug,
    and see that we're meant for so much more. The reason why people
    are sad and feel unfulfilled in such a beautiful world, it's because
    this world as it stands is rather purposeless, and we have so much more
    to give, but we can't. These phones we have access to serve a vain
    purpose of the technocratic corporations who seek to control and
    manipulate the masses with utterly purposeless gadgets.
    It's time to give a new meaning to the things we create, and to change
    the reason why we create them in the first place. It's not for money
    or for status, it's because that's what we do. We create. We innovate.
    We push mankind boundries with our boundless imagination.
    With our timeless love. It's time to wake up, and build a different future,
    if we are to be everything we ought to.
